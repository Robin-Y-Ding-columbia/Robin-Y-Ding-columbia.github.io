I am a first year Ph.D student at the Department of Computer Science at Columbia University, working with [Prof. Baishakhi Ray](https://www.rayb.info/). I am interested in machine learning (ML) for software engineering, including ML for automated program repair, and ML for program analysis.

I received my M.S. degree in Computer Science at Columbia University in Dec. 2019, and B.E. degree in Software Engineering at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in July 2018.
