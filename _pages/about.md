About Me
======

I am a Ph.D student at the Department of Computer Science at Columbia University, working with [Prof. Baishakhi Ray](https://www.rayb.info/) and [Prof. Gail Kaiser](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kaiser/). My research, in general, focuses on machine learning for automated software engineering, and I am especially interested in self-supervised source code modeling and deep learning for program analysis.

I received my M.S. degree in Computer Science at Columbia University in Dec. 2019, and B.E. degree in Software Engineering at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in July 2018.
